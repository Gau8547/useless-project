Project Description
I DECIDE is fun browser based truth detector that uses speech recognition to capture spoken statements and 
humorously decide if they are true or lies. It visually displays results with 
blinking lights, a truth meter, sound effects, and a history log of past statements.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It may not sure that the user saying truth always, it decide in a fun way.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Totally unscientific, browser-based “truth detector” that listens to your voice,
randomly decides your fate, and delivers it with blinding lights, suspenseful sound effects, 
and a drama meter—because who wouldn’t want their casual chats to feel like a game show interrogation?
